## The Problem We Solve

Every codebase accumulates tribal knowledge—those critical insights about why things work the way they do, what pitfalls to avoid, and which patterns to follow. But this knowledge gets lost in:

- 🧠 **Developers' heads** when they leave or forget
- 💬 **Slack threads** that disappear into history
- 📝 **PR comments** that nobody reads again
- 📚 **Documentation** that becomes stale the moment it's written

## Our Solution: Knowledge That Lives With Your Code

**a24z-memory** captures and preserves your team's hard-won insights by anchoring them directly to your code. Unlike traditional documentation that rots or embeddings that become stale, our knowledge stays fresh because it's connected to the actual files.

When your AI assistant needs context, it doesn't get outdated embeddings—it gets your team's accumulated wisdom plus the current state of your code.

## How It Works

### 🎯 Capture Knowledge Where It Happens

When you discover something important—a tricky bug, a design pattern, an architectural decision—document it instantly:

```
"Auth middleware breaks with null headers - always validate before parsing"
→ Type: gotcha
→ Tagged as: authentication, middleware, validation
→ Anchored to: src/auth/middleware.ts
→ Stored in: .a24z/notes/ (synced via git)
```

### 🔍 Surface Knowledge When You Need It

Your AI assistant automatically accesses this knowledge:

```
You: "Why does our auth sometimes fail?"
AI: *Searches a24z-memory for auth-related gotchas*
AI: "Found a known issue: Auth middleware breaks with null headers in src/auth/middleware.ts. The team discovered this needs validation before parsing."
```

### 🔄 Knowledge That Evolves

As your code changes, the knowledge remains relevant:

- **Anchors point to files**, not embedded content
- **Git tracks changes**, showing how understanding evolved
- **Types organize knowledge** by its nature (decision, pattern, gotcha, explanation)
- **Team contributions** accumulate over time

## The Layered Knowledge Architecture

We use a four-layer stack that keeps knowledge organized, meaningful, current, and shared:

```
📊 Type Layer    → What kind of knowledge (decision, pattern, gotcha, explanation)
🏷️  Tag Layer     → Semantic categories for discovery
📝 Note Layer    → Your team's insights and explanations
🔗 Anchor Layer  → Live connections to code locations
```

Plus **Git distribution** ensures knowledge travels with your code and evolves with your team.

This isn't just storage—it's a living memory system that grows smarter with every insight your team adds.

## Real-World Impact

### For Individual Developers

- **Never lose context** when switching between projects
- **Learn from past mistakes** without repeating them
- **Understand "why"** not just "what" in unfamiliar code

### For Teams

- **Onboard faster** with accumulated team knowledge
- **Share insights** automatically through git
- **Build institutional memory** that survives team changes

### For AI Assistants

- **Context-aware responses** based on real team knowledge
- **Avoid known pitfalls** documented by your team
- **Follow established patterns** specific to your codebase

## Detailed Installation

<details>
<summary><b>Manual Installation Steps</b></summary>

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Git repository (for knowledge storage)
- MCP-compatible editor (Cursor, VS Code, Claude Code, etc.)

### Install Package

```bash
# Global installation (recommended)
npm install -g a24z-memory

# Or project-specific
npm install a24z-memory --save-dev

# Verify installation
npx a24z-memory --help
```

### Start the Server

```bash
# Keep this running in a terminal
npx a24z-memory

# Expected output:
# ✅ a24z-Memory MCP server started successfully
# 📁 MCP Server working directory: /path/to/cwd
```

### Configure Your Editor

**For Cursor/VS Code/Claude Code:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "a24z-memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "a24z-memory"]
    }
  }
}
```

**For other editors**, consult their MCP configuration documentation.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>Common Issues and Solutions</b></summary>

### 🔍 Server Not Starting

```bash
npx a24z-memory
# Should show: "✅ a24z-Memory MCP server started successfully"
# If errors, check Node version: node --version (needs 18+)
```

### 🔍 AI Not Using Tools

1. Verify server is running in separate terminal
2. Check system prompt includes tool definitions
3. Test with: "What a24z-Memory tools are available?"

### 🔍 Path Errors

Always use absolute paths:

```bash
pwd  # Get current directory
# Use this path in your commands
```

### 🔍 Repository Errors

```bash
git status  # Verify you're in a git repo
git init    # Initialize if needed
```

### 🔍 Debug Mode

```bash
DEBUG=a24z-memory:* npx a24z-memory
```

2. **Ask your AI**: "What a24z-Memory tools are available?"
3. **Start capturing**: Document your first insight about your code
4. **Experience the difference**: Watch your AI leverage accumulated knowledge

## Handoff Briefs: Seamless Knowledge Transfer

When transitioning work—whether switching projects, onboarding teammates, or handing off tasks—create a **handoff brief** that captures everything the next person needs to know:

### What Gets Included

- **Context & Current State**: Where things stand and what's been done
- **Code References**: Specific files with explanations of their role
- **Key Decisions**: Why certain approaches were taken
- **Next Steps**: What needs attention moving forward

### How It Works

```
You: "Create a handoff brief for the auth refactoring"
AI: *Generates comprehensive handoff document*
    - Overview of changes made
    - References to modified files with context
    - Outstanding tasks and considerations
    - Saved to .a24z/handoffs/ for sharing
```

Your teammate receives a complete picture—not just what changed, but **why** and **what's next**. The brief lives in your repository, traveling with the code it describes.
